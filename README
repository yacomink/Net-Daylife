NAME
    Net::Daylife - OOP for the Daylife.com API

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::Daylife;

     my $day = Net::Daylife->new('config' => { access_key => 'd3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00', shared_secret => 'c157a79031e1c40f85931829bc5fc552' });

     my $res = $day->api_call('search_getRelatedArticles', {'query' => 'flickr'});

     foreach my $a ($res->findnodes("/response/payload/article")){
            print $a->findvalue("headline") . "\n";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Daylife is an OOP wrapper for the Daylife.com API.

    Rather than try to mirror the API itself with individual object methods
    it exposes one principle method called...you guessed it, *api_call* that
    accepts an API method name and its arguments as a hash reference.

    API results are returned in a format specific handler. For example, XML
    responses are returned as *XML::XPath* objects, JSON responses as
    *JSON::XS* objects and so on.

    Currently only HTTP level errors are handled. API specific errors are
    left to the developer. At some point I may add format specific packages
    (Net::Daylife::XML, etc.) at which point it will make more sense to
    check response codes automagically.

OPTIONS
    Options are passed to Net::Daylife using a hashref containing the
    following:

    *   access_key

        String. *required*

        Your Daylife API access key.

    *   shared_secret

        String. *required*

        Your Daylife API shared secret.

    *   format

        String.

        Return API results in a specific format. Valid options are :

        *   xml

            API results will be parsed with and returned as a *XML::XPath*
            object.

        *   json

            API results will be parsed with and returned as a *JSON::XS*
            object.

        *   php

            API results will be parsed with *PHP::Serialization* (or
            unserialize as the case may be) and returned as a hash.

            Why would you want to do this when you can just use JSON? That's
            your business, really...

        The default is xml

    *   host

        String.

        Which Daylife API server to talk to.

        The default is freeapi.daylife.com

    *   version

        String.

        Which version of the Daylife API to use.

        The default is 4.2

LOGGING AND REPORTING
    Logging is handled by an internal *Log::Dispatch* method and errors are
    written to STDERR. There is a *log* object method for accessing the
    dispatch handler directly.

PACKAGE METHODS
  __PACKAGE__->new( config => { access_key => 'd3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00', shared_secret => 'c157a79031e1c40f85931829bc5fc552' } )
    *Net::Daylife* subclasses *LWP::UserAgent*. In addition its parent
    class' arguments you must include the following :

    *   config

        A hashref as described in the OPTIONS section of this documentation.

    Returns a *Net::Daylife* object!

OBJECT METHODS YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT
  $obj->api_call($method, \%args)
    Execute an API call for the method called *$method*, passing *%args* as
    the ...well, arguments.

    On success returns a format-specific object handler. On failure, returns
    false.

OBJECT METHODS YOU MAY CARE ABOUT
  $obj->execute_request($method, \%args)
    Execute an API call for the method called *$method*, passing *%args* as
    the ...well, arguments.

    On success returns an *HTTP::Response* handler. On failure, returns
    false.

  $obj->sign_args(\%args)
    Sign the arguments for an API call with the object's Daylife API shared
    secret.

    Returns a sting.

  $obj->parse_response(HTTP::Response)
    Helper method to juggle and hand off an API response to the correct
    format handler.

    Returns either an object or false.

  $obj->parse_response_xml(HTTP::Response)
    Parse an API response in to an *XML::XPath* object.

    Returns false, otherwise.

  $obj->parse_response_json(HTTP::Response)
    Parse an API response in to an *JSON::XS* object.

    Returns false, otherwise.

  $obj->parse_response_php(HTTP::Response)
    Parse an API response in to a hash using *PHP::Serialization*.

    Returns false, otherwise.

  $obj->log()
    Access to the object's internal *Log::Dispatch* object.

  $obj->cfg()
    Access to the object's Config.
